  <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Oneirism is a single-player traversal game with a linear progression structure. Players must navigate a sequence of surreal obstacle arenas, platforming challenges, and cinematic trap sequences. There is no combat — the core gameplay loop is environmental mastery.
  </p>

  <h3>Level Progression</h3>
  <div class="stage">
    <h4>1. Spawn & Obstacle Arena</h4>

    <p>
      The player spawns at a glowing rune, then learns traversal by navigating molten spikes and a sweeping sword trap.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="stage">
    <h4>2. Chain Bridge & Blades</h4>

    <p>
      A suspended golden chain bridge is crossed while dodging giant spinning blades. This tests rhythm and positioning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="stage">
    <h4>3. Parkour Descent & Vertical Ascent</h4>
    <img src="assets/images/parkour-highlight.png" alt="Vertical parkour zone" />
    <p>
      Players drop into a black void with floating monoliths, pillars, and platforms, making full use of vertical climbing and motion matching.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="stage">
    <h4>4. Lightning Axe Sequence</h4>
    <img src="assets/images/lightning-highlight.png" alt="Lightning axe trap event" />
    <p>
      Stepping forward triggers a cinematic trap: a lightning axe rises, spirals, then crashes toward the player. Time to run.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="stage">
    <h4>5. Meme Room & Final Ascent</h4>
    <p>
      A hidden chair easter egg references Vergil from Devil May Cry. From there, players ascend glowing cubes through an anti-gravity final climb to reach the summit.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Core Mechanics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🎮 Movement: Smooth locomotion via UE5’s motion matching system</li>
    <li>🔥 Hazards: Lava pits, rotating swords, timed events</li>
    <li>🚀 Portal Warps: Teleportation between stages</li>
    <li>🧗‍♂️ Parkour: Vertical traversal using mantling, wall-jumps, and precision timing</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tips for Players</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>⏱ Timing is everything — don’t rush the blade sequences.</li>
    <li>🧭 Use visual clues — glowing runes and golden portals mark the path.</li>
    <li>🎉 Explore side paths for surprises — not all progress is linear.</li>
  </ul>
