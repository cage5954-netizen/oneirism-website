  <h2>About Oneirism</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Oneirism</strong> is a surrealist traversal game built in Unreal Engine 5. It blends dream logic with environmental storytelling, platforming, and atmospheric design. Set in a lava-drenched voidscape, players explore a linear progression of cinematic arenas and mechanics — all designed to challenge intuition rather than just reflex.

  <h3>Development Story</h3>
  <p>
    This project was independently created and implemented by <strong>John Zhang</strong>, integrating skills in level design, animation systems (UE5’s motion matching), and game logic. Oneirism began as a personal exploration of narrative-ambient design, then evolved into a full prototype reflecting themes of perception, liminality, and surreal traversal.

  <h3>Design Principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🎮 Movement-Centric: No combat — only traversal, timing, and situational awareness.</li>
    <li>🎭 Story Through Space: Environments themselves communicate tone and progression.</li>
    <li>⚙️ UE5 Technologies: Utilizes Niagara effects, Blueprint scripting, cinematic triggers, and motion matching locomotion.</li>
    <li>🧠 Built with Design Thinking: Iterative level construction based on playtesting and thematic refinement.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>System Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🔸 <strong>Minimum:</strong> GTX 1050 Ti / i5-9400F / 8 GB RAM</li>
    <li>🌟 <strong>Recommended:</strong> RTX 3060 / i7-12700 / 16 GB RAM</li>
  </ul>
