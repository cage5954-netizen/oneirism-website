      <h1>BORN FROM A BURN</h1>
      <p>
        Oneirism began about a year and a half ago, At the first year of university, I was having troubles with sleeping long hours. 
        I accidentally burned my left hand one evening. The sharp pain lingered as I drifted into a medicated sleep, and I was pulled into a vivid, 
        relentless series of dreams — a surreal, lava-drenched world where familiar objects and echoes of my past flickered like half-remembered memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I woke, the burn’s sting clung to me, but then the discomfort ignited something. Later on, I found out there's the existence
        of “oneirism”: a state where someone is caught in a chain of dreams, semi-aware of their unreality yet anchored by a heavy,
        drowsy fog that blocks escape from sleep, endlessly cycling through shifting dreamscapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I don't know if I fully experienced this, but I felt a shred of resemblance to what it's trying to say. It compelled me to find a way to recreate that
        experience — to shape it, render it, and walk through it. Unreal Engine 5 felt like the only tool I needed. I didn’t plan for
        this to become a “project.” It just... evolved. One sequence, one obstacle, one feeling at a time.

      <h2>WHAT IT’S TRYING TO BE</h2>
      <p>
        Oneirism isn’t trying to be a game in the traditional sense. There are no enemies. No tutorials. No pop-ups telling you what to do.
        It’s more of a surreal traversal gauntlet — a sensory sketchbook of movement, perception, and dream-logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every element exists to ask a question, not give an answer. The world doesn’t explain itself — but it responds to you. It watches.
        It shifts. Sometimes it repeats. It’s not trying to be fair. It’s trying to be honest.

      <h2>MAKING IT REAL</h2>
      <p>
        The game was built using UE5’s Blueprint scripting, Niagara VFX, and motion-matching tools. Development was iterative — new
        mechanics were added, tested, and refined as ideas evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visual elements were frequently revised or removed entirely if they didn’t serve the intended feeling. Each feature, camera cut,
        and traversal event was tested until the environment felt responsive and deliberate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oneirism remains a work-in-progress, but at its core, it’s a consistent effort to simulate dreamlike logic using responsive level
        design and real-time rendering.
